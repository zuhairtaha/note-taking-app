            Note-taking (sometimes written as notetaking or note taking) is the practice of recording information
            captured from another source. By taking notes, the writer records the essence of the information, freeing
            their mind from having to recall everything. Notes are commonly drawn from a transient source, such as an
            oral discussion at a meeting, or a lecture (notes of a meeting are usually called minutes), in which case
            the notes may be the only record of the event. Note taking is a form of self discipline.
